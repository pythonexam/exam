# DNA Files

Write the functions described in `exercise.py`.

An important part of this homework is to avoid the repetition of similar code:
try to define one or more support function to ease your work, and try to define
`translate_codons` and `proteins` by leveraging on the functions you already
defined.

You can test your solution locally by running: `python exercise.py -v`

Please note that the biological terminology could be simplified or inaccurate!
